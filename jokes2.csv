The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""",

Your mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said.

"The Prospector. In 1897 a young man set out for adventure from the frontier city of Seattle. He'd risked his entire life savings to make the trek to the Yukon to prospect for gold. He started his journey full of excitement and hope. he'd purchased his 2,000lbs of gear and supplies and two fine stock horses to help him carry it. The voyage to Skagway was difficult. The seas were rough and he spent many hours at the rail, emptying his stomach into the frigid, frothing waters. His journey from Skagway to the Klondike wasn't any easier. Halfway through the journey, a blizzard caught him by surprise. One of his two pack horses didn't survive the frigid night. Wolves took care of the other three days later. Pressing on he finally arrived in the Yukon, pulling his sled by hand. There, he discovered that all the claims had been taken, except for one on the outskirts of the town. The claim hadn't been taken as it seemed to have little promise. He worked the claim for weeks, with his gold pan, his pick, and his shovel. Day after day he toiled, his supplies and hope dwindling with each shovel-full of frozen soil lifted from the earth. After 9 months, his food supplies were exhausted, as were his mind and body. For all his labor, he still had nothing to show for all his labor. Dejected and despairing, he made his way back to Dawson and spent his last dollar on a shot of watered-down whiskey. He'd brought his gold pan with him to use as a plate for a meal, but he didn't have the means to purchase even a cup of caribou stew. With tears welling in his eyes, he left the bar and slumped to the muddy boardwalk outside the blacksmith shop. The pan dropped from his dejected fingers onto the ground in front of him. After all his labor, sacrifice, sweat, blood, and tears, he had nothing to show for it. Full of shame and despair, he wept in bitterness unabashedly, heedless of the men passing by on the boardwalk. A few minutes later, a prospector in a fine broadcloth suit and a bear skin coat passed by young man. Looking down at him, he took pity on the broken young man. From his pocket he pulled forth a nugget the size of an acorn. Bending low, he dropped it into his discarded pan with a loud clang. The young man, aroused by this sound, shook himself free of his stupified state. He stared down into the pan, disbelief dawning on his tear stained face. Looking up at the prospector, with gratitude in his eyes, he said in a breaking voice, ""Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!"" ",

"The instant orgasm trick. \*\*\*\*This is an old one, but I haven't seen it in 2 decades, so here goes.. The more experienced readers are probably already familiar with this trick, but, for the others who want to give their man something truly special... This works best as a surprise, so don't tell him exactly what you're going to do -- just ask him to lay back, and assure him that it will be a ""very pleasurable experience!"" Said in the right tone of voice, this alone is often enough to get him fully aroused.  If not, bring him to full erection with some oral sex (a ""blow job"").  Try to apply some pressure against the penis with your lips, but take care not to bite.  It also helps to suck \*hard\*.  You might also caress his testicles (""balls"") \*gently\*.  In spite of these tips, it's impossible to really do this wrong.  Remember the old adage about oral sex being like pizza -- even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. If he's already rock hard, then omit or severely limit the above stimulation, as you're likely to bring him to orgasm right there. This is especially true with younger (under 25) men. Tell him to close his eyes and prepare for a surprise.  Take one testicle in each hand and quickly squeeze as hard as you can. Don't worry; you can't hurt him.  Actually, the most common mistake is not to squeeze hard enough.  This has the effect of forcing the semen out and triggering an immediate, incredibly powerful orgasm. It is not uncommon for men to groan, writhe, flail, or even scream at this point.  In the confusion of the overwhelming pleasure, some men might even tell you to let go.  Don't do it!  There is nothing more disappointing to a man than to ejaculate with no stimulation.  Keep squeezing for 10-20 seconds, or until he calms down and his whole body relaxes.  Then let go. He'll remember you for the rest of his life!",
