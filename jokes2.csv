"Your Duck is Dead !!. A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. ""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything He might just be in a coma or something."" The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!"" The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150."""

Your mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said.

"The Prospector. In 1897 a young man set out for adventure from the frontier city of Seattle. He'd risked his entire life savings to make the trek to the Yukon to prospect for gold. He started his journey full of excitement and hope. he'd purchased his 2,000lbs of gear and supplies and two fine stock horses to help him carry it. The voyage to Skagway was difficult. The seas were rough and he spent many hours at the rail, emptying his stomach into the frigid, frothing waters. His journey from Skagway to the Klondike wasn't any easier. Halfway through the journey, a blizzard caught him by surprise. One of his two pack horses didn't survive the frigid night. Wolves took care of the other three days later. Pressing on he finally arrived in the Yukon, pulling his sled by hand. There, he discovered that all the claims had been taken, except for one on the outskirts of the town. The claim hadn't been taken as it seemed to have little promise. He worked the claim for weeks, with his gold pan, his pick, and his shovel. Day after day he toiled, his supplies and hope dwindling with each shovel-full of frozen soil lifted from the earth. After 9 months, his food supplies were exhausted, as were his mind and body. For all his labor, he still had nothing to show for all his labor. Dejected and despairing, he made his way back to Dawson and spent his last dollar on a shot of watered-down whiskey. He'd brought his gold pan with him to use as a plate for a meal, but he didn't have the means to purchase even a cup of caribou stew. With tears welling in his eyes, he left the bar and slumped to the muddy boardwalk outside the blacksmith shop. The pan dropped from his dejected fingers onto the ground in front of him. After all his labor, sacrifice, sweat, blood, and tears, he had nothing to show for it. Full of shame and despair, he wept in bitterness unabashedly, heedless of the men passing by on the boardwalk. A few minutes later, a prospector in a fine broadcloth suit and a bear skin coat passed by young man. Looking down at him, he took pity on the broken young man. From his pocket he pulled forth a nugget the size of an acorn. Bending low, he dropped it into his discarded pan with a loud clang. The young man, aroused by this sound, shook himself free of his stupified state. He stared down into the pan, disbelief dawning on his tear stained face. Looking up at the prospector, with gratitude in his eyes, he said in a breaking voice, ""Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!"" "

"The instant orgasm trick. \*\*\*\*This is an old one, but I haven't seen it in 2 decades, so here goes.. The more experienced readers are probably already familiar with this trick, but, for the others who want to give their man something truly special... This works best as a surprise, so don't tell him exactly what you're going to do -- just ask him to lay back, and assure him that it will be a ""very pleasurable experience!"" Said in the right tone of voice, this alone is often enough to get him fully aroused.  If not, bring him to full erection with some oral sex (a ""blow job"").  Try to apply some pressure against the penis with your lips, but take care not to bite.  It also helps to suck \*hard\*.  You might also caress his testicles (""balls"") \*gently\*.  In spite of these tips, it's impossible to really do this wrong.  Remember the old adage about oral sex being like pizza -- even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. If he's already rock hard, then omit or severely limit the above stimulation, as you're likely to bring him to orgasm right there. This is especially true with younger (under 25) men. Tell him to close his eyes and prepare for a surprise.  Take one testicle in each hand and quickly squeeze as hard as you can. Don't worry; you can't hurt him.  Actually, the most common mistake is not to squeeze hard enough.  This has the effect of forcing the semen out and triggering an immediate, incredibly powerful orgasm. It is not uncommon for men to groan, writhe, flail, or even scream at this point.  In the confusion of the overwhelming pleasure, some men might even tell you to let go.  Don't do it!  There is nothing more disappointing to a man than to ejaculate with no stimulation.  Keep squeezing for 10-20 seconds, or until he calms down and his whole body relaxes.  Then let go. He'll remember you for the rest of his life!"

"There was once a boy named Al who had special magical powers.. He could produce any kind of delicious food imaginable at the blink of an eye just by touching a utensil. People from all around his village would come everyday to witness this themselves.They would bring a bowl or a plate from their home and return with it being full of delicious food. Whenever anyone came up to him with a bowl, he would just proudly say ""Ready the bowl, Mam !""and in a puff of smoke that bowl would be full of whatever that person desired to eat.He could make sweets , he could make beverages , he could make anything the heart desired, and he helped everyone with his gift. Because of this helpful nature he was beloved by everyone in the village. All the girls liked him and all the boys wanted to be friends with him. Except for one who one day out of jealousy ran to the king and told him everything about Al and his powers because he wished for Al to be captured by him, And the greedy king took the bait and sent his soldiers to capture Al by any means necessary. But Al was warned beforehand by a well-wisher of him at the court whom Al had helped once.So he ran away from the village, from everything he knew. His family, His friends, His life.He ran until he could run no longer and he slipped and collapsed. When he opened his eyes the next time he saw that he was in some sort of a hut with an old guy tending to his wounds. Startled he immediately tried to flee, but the old man reassured him that no harm would come his way there. He told him that he was a woodcutter, He made a meagre income to sustain himself and his livestock. After feeling reassured Al decided that he is going to live here now and help the old man. He said to the old man the he doesn't need to do work anymore now that he's here. He asked the old man to bring him a plate or a bowl. The puzzled old man brought him a plate and a glass. Al took the plate and with a proud smile he said ""ready the plate, Sir!"" and Poof!, The plate was filled with delicious roasted chicken and herb-basted potatoes with the glass filled with the finest beer in the whole kingdom. Dumbstruck the Old man after tasting the food a bit merrily ate the most delicious meal of his life. After that beautiful meal the old man thanked Al but told him that it's not that he HAS to chop wood. It's just a part of his life and that he loves going to the market and meeting people there. Al confided and decided to go with the old man to the market everyday, because if he wished to live a normal life, he was going to need to learn some basic skills. So the old man took Al as his apprentice and taught him everything that he knew. He found joy in the young boy trying to learn his craft and was happy with his dedication to working. Slowly as time passed on that young boy became a young adult, with the old man now confined to his hut due to his health. Al took care of everything now, He would make him soup and chop wood to buy medicine from the local apothecary. But as slowly more time passed it became evident that the old man was nearing his end. One day when Al returned from the market he saw the old man lying on the bed, Al quickly rushed to his side where the old man put his hand on Al and told him how much he loved him, about how he was like his son he never had, with tears in his eyes , Al thanked the old man for saving him and as he was thanking he felt the hand of the old man slowly slipping from his shoulders, with the last words by him being about forgiveness and compassion, with Al now again after all these years left without a family. He arranged a proper burial of the old man in the woods where he just sat near his grave thinking what he was going to do next. After all this time he finally had time again to think about his old life his family, his friendss, his old village. He decided to go visit his old village, assured that nobody should be able to recognize him after all these years. He knew that the old greedy king was no more and thus he was able to easily reach his village. Upon reaching he saw that the village he once knew was no longer there. In it's place was a dilapidated town where everything was dark even the people everyone was mean to everyone else. Nobody laughed or played anymore. As he reached the townsquare he saw a man alone on a stage speaking to the 10-15 people who were there. As Al walked closer to hear what was being said, He was shocked. The person there spoke of Al, about how he had wronged Al when they were just kids, about how Al was the life of the village , about how he was sorry for doing all this to him and about how he has been speaking at that very spot there for years trying to remind the people of that town of the good in their hearts. After hearing all this Al recognised that man to be the kid that wronged him and he started to get angry but then he saw the man take a tray from his pouch and show it to everyone and then shouted, ""Al ! If you are here, know that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything that I did to you. If you could find it in your heart please forgive the man that stands in front of you and fill this tray and this town with your magic. Make this town remember its roots again"" After hearing all this Al was fuming with anger. How could he ? How could he expect forgiveness after ruining his life. Feeling almost disgusted he started to leave but then he remembered the old mans words. He thought about all the good times he has had with him, and he remembered his message about forgiveness and compassion. After a minute of standing still he slowly started making his way towards the stage until he was standing in front of the crowd. The man on the stage a little surprised asked Al ""Who are you ?"" Tearing up he stepped forth , took the tray and with the same proud feeling that he once felt ,smiling gleefully,screamed at the top of his lungs, ""I'm Al, Ready Tray, Sir ! "" "

You will not be recognized nor will you garner any riches, be it gold and other riches."" ""And the good?"" ""The good path will make you great and well known among many. You will be ahead of everyone else and the numbers will flow to you, they will be on your side. But..."" The fortune teller stops and peers back into the crystal ball which flickered. ""But what? It already sounds great, I'd choose that in a heartbeat, so what more is there?"" Asked the man who got excited but became nervous once again. ""All this fame and fortune will lead this to become the worst thing which everybody hates and despises."" The crystal ball suddenly became as black as can be.

"A tale of two brothers. There were two dwarfs who decided to visit the city one night. They were twin brothers from a remote country town, and had decided to go out and celebrate their 21st birthday. After some drinks and a nice dinner out, they were walking to the bus stop to go home, when they passed by a brothel. They knew both of them were virgins, so after a quick conversation, they decided that there was no better way to finish of their night of celebration than by getting laid for the very first time. They entered the brothel, chose a girl each and headed into seperate rooms to enjoy what would likely be the best night of their life. Despite his best efforts, the first brother was struggling to copulate with his girl. He tried it in doggy, missionary, reverse cowgirl - just about every position he could think of. But nothing seemed to work. It didn't help that he could hear thumping and thudding from the room next door, and his brother panting and repeatedly saying ""One, two, three ahh. One, two, three ahh"". After about 15 minutes, he gave up trying and walked out of the room, only to see his brother leaving his room too, gasping for breath and covered in sweat. He said him ""that was terrible. I tried everything, but I just couldn't make it work. I feel so embarrassed"". And his brother said ""you think that's bad? I couldn't get up on the bed!""."

"In Soviet Union, there was an experiment to test whether an army sergeant was smarter than a monkey.. So the scientists set up two rooms: the first room had a banana suspended from the ceiling and the second room had a bottle of vodka suspended from the ceiling. They let the monkey into its room. The monkey sees the banana and tries jumping up to grab it. It’s too high. The monkey tries harder. It gets closer to grabbing the banana, but it’s still out of reach. The monkey looks around the room. It notices that there is a stick lying on the floor. The monkey picks up the stick and starts hitting the banana with it - eventually it breaks off the string and the monkey eats it. Next it’s the sergeant’s turn. He sees the vodka and tries jumping up to grab it, but it’s too high. The sergeant keep jumping up over and over to try and grab the bottle, but he still can’t reach it. He tires himself out, so he sits down on a chair. “Think, sergeant! Think!” yell the scientists. “This is not the time to think, it’s the time to jump!”"

"Newton [Long]. A man called Newton goes to a Chinese restaurant. He orders some fortune cookies. When they arrive, he opens one and sees what's in it. Only one word is written: *Newton* Newton raises his eyes in a mixture of confusion and surprise. How the hell did that coincidence happen? Why was his name printed on that fortune cookie sheet? He finishes his meal, the thought still on his mind. He then goes to see the chef to ask what's going on. The chef replies that he has no idea and that it must just be a mistake. Newton forgets about the matter entirely and goes home. Several weeks later, he comes again to dine again at the Chinese restaurant, since he's gotten a bit tired of pizza. He orders a fortune cookie and some noodles. When he opens the fortune cookie, however, this odd sight greets him inside. *Newton, but* Now the memories of his previous visit come flooding back. It can't be a coincidence this time, surely...but the chef still insists that it must be a coincidence. He gives up, and goes home. Months later, the man is out on a date, and he stops at the restaurant again. They both go in. He just orders noodles this time but his date orders a fortune cookie. When the cookie arrives, she opens it and gasps. She immediately shows it to the man, who almost snaps at the sight of the contents. *Newton, but where's* The chef still denies that this is being done on purpose, of course, and the man gives up and instead decides to treat his date to some Italian food instead. After that, the date goes splendidly. they both strike it off and they start dating more often. Some months after that, the man proposes to her and she accepts. Then a year later, the wedding is about to be held. Both the man and his wife feel like the happiest people on earth. Their union as man and wife is done and they embrace each other in a passionate kiss. After that, a grand dinner is held, but the man recognises one of the caterers there. ""Hey, aren't you the guy at that one Chinese restaurant?"", he asks. ""Yes, sir, but unfortunately it closed down a month back, so I have become a caterer for this place"", he replies. The man raises his eyebrows, remembering the entire fortune cookie thing. ""Say, that whole fortune cookie thing was just a coincidence, right?"" The chef nods. ""Of course, sir! If you'd like, I can make you one right now to prove it!"" The man reluctantly agrees, and at the end of the dinner the fortune cookie arrives. He slowly opens it, trying to remember the contents of the previous ones. ""Newton, but where's""...something? Where's what? A wife, perhaps? Was this just fate's way of foreshadowing his marriage today? Of course...he gives a contented smile thinking about it. It all makes sense. Maybe he shouldn't have gotten so upset over it after all. He breaks open the fortune cookie finally, and reads it out loud in his excitement. ""Newton, but where's Oldton?"""
